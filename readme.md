This is work in progress, mostly untested and experimental - please use with caution.

The initial goal is to decompress and compare the different versions of the hobbit soundtrack.
After that maybe look into unpacking and decompressing the different versions of area 51.

### Build
 * Build using Visual Studio
 * Copy mss32.dll from one of the games to the bin directory.
